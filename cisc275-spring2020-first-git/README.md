1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.
   Created Dog.java and Animal.java

2. What five objects are created in the main?
   The five objects were (1) ArrayList, (3) Dog objects, and (1) Comparator.

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
   The Comparator Constructor call is within the MyCompare.java class.  It doesn't seem that we need a class that explicitly states that it implements comparator.  I guess what that means is that as long as a class implements the right methods, then it by default implements the interface to which those methods belong?
